hinged-tess-app
===============

A javascript app which lets the user create a number of different hinged tessellations.

Written for the sake of demonstrating that any quadrilateral with any two angles adding up to 180 degrees will always be hinge-tessellable.

Read more about hinged tessellations and this code in my personal website [Hinged Tessellations (Part 1)](http://algrant.ca/projects/hinged-tessellations).
